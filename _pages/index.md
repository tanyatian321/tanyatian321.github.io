<p style="text-align: justify">
Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Management and Organizations at New York University Shanghai, and an affiliated faculty in the Management and Organizations Department at NYU Stern.
<br>
<br>
I study several empirical settings including public corporations, science and academia, and nascent and illegitimate organizations. My research is unified by the approach that bridges theory and the availability of new data and computational methods to study strategy and organizational behavior. Prior to joining NYU Shanghai, I obtained PhD from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and was a researcher in residence at the Northwestern Institute of Complex Systems (NICO). You can reach me at yt2144@nyu.edu.
